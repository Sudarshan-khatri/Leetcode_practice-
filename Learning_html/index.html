            <h1>Free GenAI 65-Hour Bootcamp</h1>
            <p>Generative AI is revolutionizing how we create, learn, and interact with digital content. From intelligent chatbots and personalized language tutors to realistic image generation and interactive story engines, the applications are endless.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about Generative AI through an immersive, 65-hour bootcamp. Created by Andrew Brown from Exam Pro and featuring over 30 guest instructors, this course is specifically designed to support learners at all skill levels. Whether you’re a complete beginner or someone with basic programming experience, the bootcamp offers a gradual, project-oriented learning path that equips you with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At the heart of this course is a comprehensive curriculum that spans the full range of modern GenAI development. It kicks off with an introduction to core tools such as Python and Jupyter Notebooks. You'll also get hands-on with essential Python data libraries, setting the stage for more complex topics like prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and AI agent construction. These building blocks are critical for understanding how large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Gemini work behind the scenes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What sets this bootcamp apart is its focus on applied learning. Instead of just watching lectures, you’ll dive into real-world projects, including the development of a suite of AI-powered applications for a Japanese Language Learning School. These projects are full-scale applications that integrate multiple technologies and demonstrate how AI can enhance educational tools. For instance, you’ll build apps that generate listening comprehension exercises, automate vocabulary teaching, and even create a visual novel experience using multimodal AI models.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By the end of the bootcamp, you’ll have a strong understanding of GenAI architecture and the ability to build and deploy your own AI-powered applications. More importantly, you’ll walk away with a portfolio of completed projects that showcase your skills—whether you're applying for jobs, building a startup, or just exploring what’s possible.</p>
